    <p>In transforming backward agricultural China into an advanced
    industrialized country, we are confronted with arduous tasks and
    our experience is far from adequate. So we must be good at
    learning. </p><p class="inline">&quot;Opening Address at the
    Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China&quot;
    (September 15, 1956).</p><p>Conditions are changing all the time,
    and to adapt one's thinking to the new conditions, one must
    study. Even those who have a better grasp of Marxism and are
    comparatively firm in their proletarian stand have to go on
    studying, have to absorb what is new and study new
    problems. </p><p class="inline">Speech at the Chinese Communist
    Party's National Conference on Propaganda Work (March 12, 1957),
    1st pocket ed., p. 8.*</p><p>We can learn what we did not know. We
    are not only good at destroying the Old World, we are also good at
    building the new. </p><p class="inline">&quot;Report to the Second
    Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist
    Party of China&quot; (March 5, 1949), Selected Works, Vol. IV,
    p. 374.</p><p>Now, there are two different attitudes towards
    learning from others. One is the dogmatic attitude of
    transplanting everything, whether or not it is suited to our
    conditions. This is no good. The other attitude is to use our
    heads and learn those things that suit our conditions, that is, to
    absorb whatever experience is useful to us. That is the attitude
    we should adopt. </p><p class="inline">On the Correct Handling of
    Contradictions among the People (February 27, 1957), 1st pocket
    ed., p. 75.</p><p>The theory of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin is
    universally applicable. We should regard it not as a dogma, but as
    a guide to action. Studying it is not merely a matter of learning
    terms and phrases but of learning Marxism-Leninism as the science
    of revolution. It is not just a matter of understanding the
    general laws derived by Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin from their
    extensive study of real life and revolutionary experience, but of
    studying their standpoint and method in examining and solving
    problems. </p><p class="inline">&quot;The Role of the Chinese
    Communist Party in the National War&quot; (October 1938), Selected
    Works, Vol. II, pp. 208-09.</p><p>If we have a correct theory but
    merely prate about it, pigeonhole it and do not put it into
    practice, then that theory, however good, is of no
    significance. </p><p class="inline">&quot;On Practice&quot; (July
    1937), Selected Works, Vol. I, p. 304.</p><p>It is necessary to
    master Marxist theory and apply it, master it for the sole purpose
    of applying it. If you can apply the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint in
    elucidating one or two practical problems, you should be commended
    and credited with some achievement. The more problems you
    elucidate and the more comprehensively and profoundly you do so,
    the greater will be your achievement. </p><p
    class="inline">&quot;Rectify the Party's Style of Work&quot;
    (February 1, 1942), Selected Works, Vol. III, p. 38.</p><p>How is
    Marxist-Leninist theory to be linked with the practice of the
    Chinese revolution? To use a common expression, it is by
    &quot;shooting the arrow at the target&quot;. As the arrow is to
    the target, so is Marxism-Leninism to the Chinese revolution. Some
    comrades, however, are &quot;shooting without a target&quot;,
    shooting at random, and such people are liable to harm the
    revolution. </p><p class="inline">Ibid., p. 42.</p><p>Those
    experienced in work must take up the study of theory and must read
    seriously; only then will they be able to systematize and
    synthesize their experience and raise it to the level of theory,
    only then will they not mistake their partial experience for
    universal truth and not commit empiricist errors. </p><p
    class="inline">Ibid. </p><p>Reading is learning, but applying is
    also learning and the more important kind of learning at that. Our
    chief method is to learn warfare through warfare. A person who has
    had no opportunity to go to school can also learn warfare - he can
    learn through fighting in war. A revolutionary war is a mass
    undertaking; it is often not a matter of first learning and then
    doing, but of doing and then learning, for doing is itself
    learning. </p><p class="inline">&quot;Problems of Strategy in
    China's Revolutionary War&quot; (December 1936), Selected Works,
    Vol. I, pp. 189-90.</p><p>There is a gap between the ordinary
    civilian and the soldier, but it is no Great Wall, and it can be
    quickly closed, and the way to close it is to take part in
    revolution, in war. By saying that it is not easy to learn and to
    apply, we mean that it is hard to learn thoroughly and to apply
    skillfully. By saying that civilians can very quickly become
    soldiers, we mean that it is not difficult to cross the
    threshold. To put the two statements together, we may cite the
    Chinese adage, &quot;Nothing in the world is difficult for one who
    sets his mind to it.&quot; To cross the threshold is not
    difficult, and mastery, too, is possible provided one sets one's
    mind to the task and is good at learning. </p><p
    class="inline">Ibid., p. 190.</p><p>We must learn to do economic
    work from all who know how, no matter who they are. We must esteem
    them as teachers, learning from them respectfully and
    conscientiously. We must not pretend to know when we do not
    know. </p><p class="inline">&quot;On the People's Democratic
    Dictatorship&quot; (June 30, 1949), Selected Works, Vol. IV,
    p. 423.</p><p>Knowledge is a matter of science and no dishonesty
    or conceit whatsoever is permissible. What is required is
    definitely the reverse - honesty and modesty. </p><p
    class="inline">&quot;On Practice&quot; (July 1937), Selected
    Works, Vol. I, p. 300.</p><p>Complacency is the enemy of study. We
    cannot really learn anything until we rid ourselves of
    complacency. Our attitude towards ourselves should be &quot;to be
    insatiable in learning&quot; and towards others &quot;to be
    tireless in teaching&quot;. </p><p class="inline">&quot;The Role
    of the Chinese Communist Party in the National War&quot; (October
    1938), Selected Works, Vol. II, p. 210.</p><p>Some people have
    read a few Marxist books and think themselves quite learned but
    what they have read has not penetrated, has not struck root in
    their minds, so that they do not know how to use it and their
    class feelings remain as of old. Others are very conceited and
    having learned some book-phrases, think them terrific and are very
    cocky; but whenever a storm blows up, they take a stand very
    different from that of the workers and the majority of the
    peasants. They waver while the latter stand firm, they equivocate
    while the latter are forthright. </p><p class="inline">Speech at
    the Chinese Communist Party's National Conference on Propaganda
    Work (March 12, 1957), 1st pocket ed., pp. 7-8.</p><p>In order to
    have a real grasp of Marxism, one must learn it not only from
    books, but mainly through class struggle, through practical work
    and close contact with the masses of workers and peasants. When in
    addition to reading some Marxist books our intellectuals have
    gained some understanding through close contact with the masses of
    workers and peasants and through their own practical work, we will
    all be speaking the same language, not only the common language of
    patriotism and the common language of the socialist system, but
    probably even the common language of the communist world
    outlook. If that happens, all of us will certainly work much
    better. </p><p class="inline">Ibid., p. 12.</p><p>Notes:  Yenan was
    the headquarters of the Central Committee of the Communist Party
    of China from January 1937 until March 1947; Sian was the center
    of reactionary rule of the Kuomintang in northwestern China.
    Comrade Mao Tse-tung cited the two cities as symbols of revolution
    and counter-revolution.This refers to the revolutionary armed
    forces organized jointly by the Chinese Communists Party and the
    Kuomintang in the years of their co-operation during the First
    Revolutionary Civil War Period (1924-27). - Tr. Campaigns to
    &#147;support the government and cherish the people&#148; and to
    &#147;support the army and give preferential treatment to the
    families of soldiers fighting Japan&#148;. -Tr.   The Three
    &#147;Check-ups&#148; and &#147;Three Improvements&#148;
    constituted an important movement for Party consolidation and for
    ideological education in the army which was carried out by our
    Party in conjunction with the land reform during the People&#146;s
    War of Liberation.  In the localities, the &#147;Three
    Check-ups&#148; meant checking on class origin, ideology and style
    of work; in the armed units, the check ups where on class origin,
    performance of duty and will to fight.  The &#147;Three
    Improvements&#148; meant organizational consolidation, ideological
    education and rectification of style of work.  </p>
