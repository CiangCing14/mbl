7. Dare to Struggle and Dare to Win
</h3>

    <p>People of the world, unite and defeat the U.S. aggressors and
    all their running dogs! People of the world, be courageous, and
    dare to fight, defy difficulties and advance wave upon wave. Then
    the whole world will belong to the people. Monsters of all kinds
    shall be destroyed. </p><p class="inline">&quot;Statement
    Supporting the People of the Congo (L.) Against
    U.S. Aggression&quot; (November 28, 1964), People of the World,
    Unite and Defeat the U.S. Aggressors and All Their Lackeys, 2nd
    ed., p. 14.</p><p>The Communist Party of China, having made a
    clear-headed appraisal of the international and domestic situation
    on the basis of the science of Marxism-Leninism, recognized that
    all attacks by the reactionaries at home and abroad had to be
    defeated and could be defeated. When dark clouds appeared in the
    sky, we pointed out that they were only temporary, that the
    darkness would soon pass and the sun break through. </p><p
    class="inline">&quot;The Present Situation and Our Tasks&quot;
    (December 25, 1947), Selected Military Writings, 2nd ed.,
    p. 347.</p><p>Historically, all reactionary forces on the verge of
    extinction invariably conduct a last desperate struggle against
    the revolutionary forces, and some revolutionaries are apt to be
    deluded for a time by this phenomenon of outward strength but
    inner weakness failing to grasp the essential fact that the enemy
    is nearing extinction while they themselves are approaching
    victory. </p><p class="inline">&quot;The Turning Point in World
    War II&quot; (October 12, 1942), Selected Works, Vol. III,
    p. 103.</p><p>If they [the Kuomintang] fight, we will wipe them
    out completely. This is the way things are: if they attack and we
    wipe them out, they will have that satisfaction; wipe out some,
    some satisfaction; wipe out more, more satisfaction; wipe out the
    whole lot, complete satisfaction. China's problems are
    complicated, and our brains must also be a little complicated. If
    they start fighting, we fight back, fight to win peace. </p><p
    class="inline">&quot;On the Chungking Negotiations&quot; (October
    17, 1945), Selected Works, Vol. IV, p. 56.</p><p>If anyone attacks
    us and if the conditions are favorable for battle, we will
    certainly act in self-defense to wipe him out resolutely,
    thoroughly, wholly and completely (we do not strike rashly, but
    when we do strike, we must win). We must never be cowed by the
    bluster of reactionaries. </p><p class="inline">&quot;On Peace
    Negotiations with the Kuomintang - Circular of the Central
    Committee of the Communist Party of China&quot; (August 26, 1945),
    Selected Works, Vol. IV, p. 49*</p><p>As far as our own desire is
    concerned, we do not want to fight even for a single day. However,
    if circumstances force us to fight, we can fight to the
    finish. </p><p class="inline">&quot;Talk with the American
    Correspondent Anna Louise Strong&quot; (August 1946), Selected
    Works, Vol. IV, p. 97.</p><p>We are for peace. But so long as
    U.S. imperialism refuses to give up its arrogant and unreasonable
    demands and its scheme to extend aggression, the only course for
    the Chinese people is to remain determined to go on fighting side
    by side with the Korean people. Not that we are warlike. We are
    willing to stop the war at once and leave the remaining questions
    for later settlement. However, U.S. imperialism is not willing to
    do so. All right then let the fighting go on. However many years
    U.S. imperialism wants to fight, we are ready to fight right up to
    the moment when it is willing to stop, right up to the moment of
    complete victory for the Chinese and Korean peoples. </p><p
    class="inline">Speech at the Fourth Session of the First National
    Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
    Conference (February 7, 1953).</p><p>We should rid our ranks of
    all impotent thinking. All views that overestimate the strength of
    the enemy and underestimate the strength of the people are
    wrong. </p><p class="inline">&quot;The Present Situation and Our
    Tasks&quot; (December 25, 1947), Selected Works, Vol. IV,
    p. 173.</p><p>The oppressed peoples and nations must not pin their
    hopes for liberation on the &quot;sensibleness&quot; of
    imperialism and its lackeys. They will only triumph by
    strengthening their unity and persevering in their
    struggle. </p><p class="inline">&quot;Statement Opposing
    Aggression Against Southern Vietnam and Slaughter of Its People by
    the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem Clique&quot; (August 29, 1963), People of
    the World, Unite and Defeat the U.S. Aggressors and All Their
    Lackeys, 2nd ed., p. 6.</p><p>No matter when this countrywide
    civil war breaks out, we must be well prepared. If it comes early,
    say, tomorrow morning, we should also be prepared. That is point
    one. In the present international and domestic situation, it is
    possible that for a time the civil war will be kept restricted in
    scale and localized. That is point two. Point 1 is what we should
    prepare for; point two is what has existed for a long time. In
    short, we must be prepared. Being prepared, we shall be able to
    deal properly with all kinds of complicated situations. </p><p
    class="inline">&quot;The Situation and Our Policy After the
    Victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan&quot; (August 13,
    1945), Selected Works, Vol. IV, p. 22.</p>
