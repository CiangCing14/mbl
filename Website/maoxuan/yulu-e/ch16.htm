<p>Our educational policy must enable everyone who receives an education to develop morally, intellectually and physically and become a worker with both socialist consciousness and culture. </p><p class="inline">On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People (February 27, 1959), 1st pocket ed., p. 44.</p><p>As for education for cadres whether at work or in schools for cadres, a policy should be established of focusing such education on the study of the practical problems of the Chinese revolution and using the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism as the guide, and the method of studying Marxism-Leninism statically and in isolation should be discarded. </p><p class="inline">&quot;Reform Our Study&quot; (May 1941), Selected Works, Vol. III, p. 24.</p><p>For a military school, the most important question is the selection of a director and instructors and the adoption of an educational policy. </p><p class="inline">&quot;Problems of Strategy in China's Revolutionary War&quot; (December 1936), Selected Works, Vol. I, p. 
5. *</p><p>A school of a hundred people certainly cannot be run well if it does not have a leading group of several people, or a dozen or more, which is formed in accordance with the actual circumstances (and not thrown together artificially) and is composed of the most active, upright and alert of the teachers, the other staff and the students. </p><p class="inline">&quot;Some Questions Concerning Methods of Leadership&quot; (June 1, 1943), Selected Works, Vol. III, pp. 118-l9.</p><p>All officers and fighters of our army must improve their military art, march forward courageously towards certain victory in the war and resolutely, thoroughly, wholly and completely wipe out all enemies. </p><p class="inline">&quot;Manifesto of the Chinese People's Liberation Army&quot; (October 1947), Selected Military Writings, 2nd ed., p. 340.</p><p>Equal importance should be attached to the military and political aspects of the one-year consolidation and training program that has just begun, and the two aspects should be integrated. At the start, stress should be placed on the political aspect, on improving relations between officers and men, enhancing internal unity and arousing a high level of enthusiasm among the masses of cadres and fighters. Only thus will the military consolidation and training proceed smoothly and attain better results. </p><p class="inline">&quot;The Tasks for 1945&quot; (December 15, 1944).</p><p>As for the method of training, we should unfold the mass training movement in which officers teach soldiers, soldiers teach officers and the soldiers teach each other. </p><p class="inline">&quot;Policy for Work in the Liberated Areas for 1946&quot; (December 15, 1945), Selected Works, Vol. IV, p. 76.</p><p>Our slogan in training troops is &quot;Officers teach soldiers, soldiers teach officers and soldiers teach each other&quot;. The fighters have a lot of practical combat experience. The officers should learn from the fighters, and when they have made other people's experience their own, they will become more capable. </p><p class="inline">&quot;A Talk to the Editorial Staff of the Shansi-Suiyuan Daily&quot; (April 2, 1948), Selected Works, Vol. IV, p. 243.</p><p>As for the training courses, the main objective should still be to raise the level of technique in marksmanship, bayoneting grenade-throwing and the like and the secondary objective should be to raise the level of tactics, while special emphasis should be laid on night operations. </p><p class="inline">&quot;Policy for Work in the Liberated Areas for 1946&quot; (December 15, 1945), Selected Works, Vol. IV, p. 76. *</p>
