</h3>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>

<p>The unification of our country, the unity of our people and the unity of our various nationalities - these are the basic guarantees of the sure triumph of our cause. </p>
<p class="inline">On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People (February 27, 1957). 1st pocket ed., pp. 1-2.</p>
<p>It is only through the unity of the Communist Party that the unity of the whole class and the whole nation can be achieved, and it is only through the unity of the whole class and the whole nation that the enemy can be defeated and the national and democratic revolution accomplished. </p>
<p class="inline">&quot;Win the Masses in Their Millions for the Anti-Japanese National United Front&quot; (May 7, 1937), Selected Works, Vol. I, p. 292.*</p><p>We shall solidly unite all the forces of our Party on democratic centralist principles of organization and discipline. We shall unite with any comrade if he abides by the Party's Program, Constitution and decisions. </p>
<p class="inline">&quot;On Coalition Government&quot; (April 24, 1945), Selected Works, Vol. III, p. 317.*</p>
<p>This democratic method of resolving contradictions among the people was epitomized in 1942 in the formula &quot;unity, criticism, unity&quot;. To elaborate, it means starting from the desire for unity, resolving contradictions through criticism or struggle and arriving at a new unity on a new basis. In our experience this is the correct method of resolving contradictions among the people. </p>
<p class="inline">On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People (February 27, 1957), 1st pocket ed., p. 12.</p>
<p>This [our] army has achieved remarkable unity in its own ranks and with those outside its ranks. Internally, there is unity between officers and men, between the higher and lower ranks, and between military work, political work and rear service work; and externally, there is unity between the army and the people, between the army and government organizations, and between our army and the friendly armies. It is imperative to overcome anything that impairs this unity. </p>
