<h3>
10. Leadership of Party Committees
</h3>

<hr class="end">
    <p class="skip">&#160;</p>

    <p>The Party committee system is an important Party institution
    for ensuring collective leadership and preventing any individual
    from monopolizing the conduct of affairs. It has recently been
    found that in some (of course not all) leading bodies it is the
    habitual practice for one individual to monopolize the conduct of
    affairs and decide important problems. Solutions to important
    problems are decided not by Party committee meetings but by one
    individual, and membership in the Party committee has become
    nominal. Differences of opinion among committee members cannot be
    resolved and are left unresolved for a long time. Members of the
    Party committee maintain only formal, not real, unity among
    themselves. This situation must be changed. From now on, a sound
    system of Party committee meetings must be instituted in all
    leading bodies, from the regional bureaus of the Central Committee
    to the prefectural Party committees; from the Party committees of
    the fronts to the Party committees of brigades and military areas
    (sub-commissions of the Revolutionary Military Commission or
    leading groups); and the leading Party members' groups in
    government bodies, people's organizations the news agency and the
    newspaper offices. All important problems (of course, not the
    unimportant, trivial problems, or problems whose solutions have
    already been decided after discussion at meetings and need only be
    carried out) must be submitted to the committee for discussion,
    and the committee members present should express their views fully
    and reach definite decisions which should then be carried out by
    the members concerned.... Party committee meetings must be divided
    into two categories, standing committee meetings and plenary
    sessions, and the two should not be confused. Furthermore, we must
    take care that neither collective leadership nor personal
    responsibility is overemphasized to the neglect of the other. In
    the army, the person in command has the right to make emergency
    decisions during battle and when circumstances require.</p>

    <p class="inline">&quot;On Strengthening the Party Committee
    System&quot; (September 20, 1948), Selected Works, Vol. IV,
    pp. 267-68.*</p>

    <p>The secretary of a Party committee must be good at being a
    &quot;squad leader&quot;. A Party committee has ten to twenty
    members; it is like a squad in the army, and the secretary is like
    the &quot;squad leader&quot;. It is indeed not easy to lead this
    squad well. Each regional bureau or sub-regional bureau of the
    Central Committee now leads a vast area and shoulders very heavy
    responsibilities. To lead means not only to decide general and
    specific policies but also to devise correct methods of work. Even
    with correct general and specific policies, troubles may still
    arise if methods of work are neglected. To fulfil its task of
    exercising leadership, a Party committee must rely on its
    &quot;squad members&quot; and enable them to play their parts to
    the full. To be a good &quot;squad leader&quot;, the secretary
    should study hard and investigate thoroughly. A secretary or
    deputy secretary will find it difficult to direct his
    &quot;squad&quot; well if he does not take care to do propaganda
    and organizational work among his own &quot;squad members'', is
    not good at handling his relations with committee members or does
    not study how to run meetings successfully. If the &quot;squad
    members&quot; do not march in step, they can never expect to lead
    tens of millions of people in fighting and construction. Of
    course, the relation between the secretary and the committee
    members is one in which the minority must obey the majority, so it
    is different from the relation between a squad leader and his
    men. Here we speak only by way of analogy. </p>

    <p class="inline">&quot;Methods of Work of Party Committees&quot;
    (March 13, 1949), Selected Works, Vol. IV, p. 377.*</p>

    <p>Place problems on the table. This should be done not only by
    the &quot;squad leader&quot; but by the committee members too. Do
    not talk behind people's backs. Whenever problems arise, call a
    meeting, place the problems on the table for discussion, take some
    decisions and the problems will be solved. If problems exist and
    are not placed on the table, they will remain unsolved for a long
    time and even drag on for years. The &quot;squad leader&quot; and
    the committee members should show understanding in their relations
    with each other. Nothing is more important than mutual
    understanding, support and friendship between the secretary and
    the committee members, between the Central Committee and its
    regional bureaus and between the regional bureaus and the area
    Party committees. </p><p class="inline">Ibid.,
    pp. 377-78.</p><p>&quot;Exchange information.&quot; This means
    that members of a Party committee should keep each other informed
    and exchange views on matters that have come to their
    attention. This is of great importance in achieving a common
    language. Some fail to do so and, like the people described by Lao
    Tzu, &quot;do not visit each other all their lives, though the
    crowing of their cocks and the barking of their dogs are within
    hearing of each other&quot;. The result is that they lack a common
    language. </p><p class="inline">Ibid., P. 378.</p><p>Ask your
    subordinates about matters you do not understand or do not know,
    and do not lightly express your approval or disapproval.... We
    should never pretend to know what we do not know, we should
    &quot;not feel ashamed to ask and learn from people below&quot;
    and we should listen carefully to the views of the cadres at the
    lower levels. Be a pupil before you become a teacher; learn from
    the cadres at the lower levels before you issue orders.... What
    the cadres at the lower levels say may or may not be correct,
    after hearing it, we must analyse it. We must heed the correct
    views and act upon them.... Listen also to the mistaken views from
    below, it is wrong not to listen to them at all. Such views,
    however, are not to be acted upon but to be criticized. </p><p
    class="inline">Ibid., pp. 378-79 *</p><p>Learn to &quot;play the
    piano&quot;. In playing the piano, all ten fingers are in motion;
    it will not do to move some fingers only and not others. However,
    if all ten fingers press down at once, there is no melody. To
    produce good music, the ten fingers should move rhythmically and
    in co-ordination. A Party committee should keep a firm grasp on
    its central task and at the same time, around the central task, it
    should unfold the work in other fields. At present, we have to
    take care of many fields; we must look after the work in all the
    areas, armed units and departments, and not give all our attention
    to a few problems, to the exclusion of others. Wherever there is a
    problem, we must put our finger on it, and this is a method we
    must master. Some play the piano well and some badly, and there is
    a great difference in the melodies they produce. Members of Party
    committees must learn to &quot;play the piano&quot; well. </p><p
    class="inline">Ibid., p. 379.</p><p>&quot;Grasp firmly.&quot; That
    is to say, the Party committee must not merely &quot;grasp&quot;,
    but must &quot;grasp firmly&quot;, its main tasks. One can get a
    grip on something only when it is grasped firmly, without the
    slightest slackening. Not to grasp firmly is not to grasp at
    all. Naturally, one cannot get a grip on something with an open
    hand. When the hand is clenched as if grasping something but is
    not clenched tightly, there is still no grip. Some of our comrades
    do grasp the main tasks, but their grasp is not firm and so they
    cannot make a success of their work. It will not do to have no
    grasp at all, nor will it do if the grasp is not firm. </p><p
    class="inline">Ibid. </p><p>&quot;Have a head for figures.&quot;
    That is to say, we must attend to the quantitative aspect of a
    situation or problem and make a basic quantitative analysis. Every
    quality manifests itself in a certain quantity, and without
    quantity, there can be no quality. To this day many of our
    comrades still do not understand that they must attend to the
    quantitative aspect of things - the basic statistics, the main
    percentages and the quantitative limits that determine the
    qualities of things. They have no &quot;figures&quot; in their
    heads and therefore cannot help making mistakes. </p><p
    class="inline">Ibid., pp. 379-80.</p><p>&quot;Notice to Reassure
    the Public.&quot; Notice of meetings should be given beforehand;
    this is like issuing a &quot;Notice to Reassure the Public&quot;,
    so that everybody will know what is going to be discussed and what
    problems are to be solved and can make timely preparations. In
    some places, meetings of cadres are called without first preparing
    reports and draft resolutions, and only when people have arrived
    for the meeting are makeshifts improvised; this is just like the
    saying, &quot;Troops and horses have arrived, but food and fodder
    are not ready&quot;, and that is no good. Do not call a meeting in
    a hurry if the preparations are not completed. </p><p
    class="inline">Ibid., p. 380.</p><p>&quot;Fewer and better troops
    and simpler administration.&quot; Talks, speeches, articles and
    resolutions should all be concise and to the point. Meetings also
    should not go on too long. </p><p class="inline">Ibid. </p><p>Pay
    attention to uniting and working with comrades who differ with
    you. This should be borne in mind both in the localities and in
    the army. It also applies to relations with people outside the
    Party. We have come together from every corner of the country and
    should be good at uniting in our work not only with comrades who
    hold the same views as we but also with those who hold different
    views. </p><p class="inline">Ibid. </p><p>Guard against
    arrogance. For anyone in a leading position, this is a matter of
    principle and an important condition for maintaining unity. Even
    those who have made no serious mistakes and have achieved very
    great success in their work should not be arrogant. </p><p
    class="inline">Ibid. </p><p>Draw two lines of distinction. First,
    between revolution and counter-revolution, between Yenan and Sian.
    Some do not understand that they must draw this line of
    distinction. For example, when they combat bureaucracy, they speak
    of Yenan as though &quot;nothing is right&quot; there and fail to
    make a comparison and distinguish between the bureaucracy in Yenan
    and the bureaucracy in Sian. This is fundamentally
    wrong. Secondly, within the revolutionary ranks, it is necessary
    to make a clear distinction between right and wrong, between
    achievements and shortcomings and to make clear which of the two
    is primary and which secondary. For instance, do the achievements
    amount to 30 per cent or to 70 per cent of the whole? It will not
    do either to understate or to overstate. We must have a
    fundamental evaluation of a person's work and establish whether
    his achievements amount to 30 per cent and his mistakes to 70 per
    cent, or vice versa. If his achievements amount to 70 per cent of
    the whole, then his work should in approve the main. It would be
    entirely wrong to describe work in which the achievements are
    primary as work in which the mistakes are primary. In our approach
    to problems, we must not forget to draw these two lines of
    distinction, between revolution and counter-revolution and between
    achievements and shortcomings. We shall be able to handle things
    well if we bear these two distinctions in mind; otherwise, we
    shall confuse the nature of the problems. To draw these
    distinctions well, careful study and analysis are of course
    necessary. Our attitude towards every person and every matter
    should be one of analysis and study. </p><p class="inline">Ibid.,
    p. 381.</p><p>In the sphere of organization, ensure democracy
    under centralized guidance. It should be done on the following
    lines:</p><p class="indentb"> (1) The leading bodies of the Party
    must give a correct line of guidance and find solutions when
    problems arise, in order to establish themselves as centers of
    leadership. </p><p class="indentb">(2) The higher bodies must be
    familiar with the situation in the lower bodies and with the life
    of the masses to have an objective basis for correct
    guidance. </p><p class="indentb">(3) No Party organization at any
    level should make casual decisions in solving problems. Once a
    decision is reached, it must be firmly carried out.</p><p
    class="indentb"> (4) All decisions of any importance made by the
    Party's higher bodies must be promptly transmitted to the lower
    bodies and the Party ordinary people.... </p><p
    class="indentb">(5) The lower bodies of the Party and the Party
    ordinary people must discuss the higher bodies' directives in
    detail in order to understand their meaning thoroughly and decide
    on the methods of carrying them out. </p><p
