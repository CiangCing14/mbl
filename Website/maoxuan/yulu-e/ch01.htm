1. The Communist Party
</h3>

<p>
      The force at the core leading our cause forward is the Chinese
      Communist Party. The theoretical basis guiding our thinking is
      Marxism-Leninism. </p><p class="inline">Opening address at the
      First Session of the First National People's Congress of the
      People's Republic of China (September 15, 1954).</p><p>If there
      is to be revolution, there must be a revolutionary
      party. Without a revolutionary party, without a party built on
      the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary theory and in the
      Marxist-Leninist revolutionary style, it is impossible to lead
      the working class and the broad masses of the people in
      defeating imperialism and its running dogs. </p><p
      class="inline">&quot;Revolutionary Forces of the World Unite,
      Fight Against Imperialist Aggression!&quot; (November 1948),
      Selected Works, Vol. IV, p. 284.*</p><p>Without the efforts of
      the Chinese Communist Party, without the Chinese Communists as
      the mainstay of the Chinese people, China can never achieve
      independence and liberation, or industrialization and the
      modernization of her agriculture. </p><p class="inline">&quot;On
      Coalition Government&quot; (April 24, 1945), Selected Works,
      Vol. III, p. 318.*</p><p>The Chinese Communist Party is the core
      of leadership of the whole Chinese people. Without this core,
      the cause of socialism cannot be victorious. </p><p
      class="inline">Talk at the general reception for the delegates
      to the Third National Congress of the New Democratic Youth
      League of China (May 25, 1957).</p><p>A well-disciplined Party
      armed with the theory of Marxism-Leninism, using the method of
      self-criticism and linked with the masses of the people; an army
      under the leadership of such a Party; a united front of all
      revolutionary classes and all revolutionary groups under the
      leadership of such a Party - these are the three main weapons
      with which we have defeated the enemy. </p><p
      class="inline">&quot;On the People's Democratic
      Dictatorship&quot; (June 30, 1949), Selected Works, Vol. IV,
      p. 422.</p><p>We must have faith in the masses and we must have
      faith in the Party. These are two cardinal principles. If we
      doubt these principles, we shall accomplish nothing. </p><p
      class="inline">On the Question of Agricultural Co-operation
      (.July 31, 1955), 3rd ed., p. 7.*</p><p>Armed with
      Marxist-Leninist theory and ideology, the Communist Party of
      China has brought a new style of work to the Chinese people. A
      style of work which essentially entails integrating theory with
      practice, forging close links with the masses and practicing
      self-criticism. </p><p class="inline">&quot;On Coalition
      Government&quot; (April 24, 1945), Selected Works, Vol. III,
      p. 314. *</p><p>No political party can possibly lead a great
      revolutionary movement to victory unless it possesses
      revolutionary theory and knowledge of history and has a profound
      grasp of the practical movement. </p><p class="inline">&quot;The
      Role of the Chinese Communist Party in the National War&quot;
      (October 1938), Selected Works, Vol. II, p. 208.</p><p>As we
      used to say, the rectification movement is &quot;a widespread
      movement of Marxist education&quot;. Rectification means the
      whole Party studying Marxism through criticism and
      self-criticism. We can certainly learn more about Marxism in the
      course of the rectification movement. </p><p
      class="inline">Speech at the Chinese Communist Party's National
      Conference on Propaganda Work (March 12, l957), 1st pocket ed.,
      p. 14.</p><p>It is an arduous task to ensure a better life for
      the several hundred million people of China and to build our
      economically and culturally backward country into a prosperous
      and powerful one with a high level of culture. And it is
      precisely in order to be able to shoulder this task more
      competently and work better together with all non-Party people
      who are actuated by high ideals and determined to institute
      reforms that we must conduct rectification movements both now
      and in the future, and constantly rid ourselves of whatever is
      wrong. </p><p class="inline">Ibid., pp. 15-16.*</p><p>Policy is
      the starting-point of all the practical actions of a
      revolutionary party and manifests itself in the process and the
      end-result of that party's actions. A revolutionary party is
      carrying out a policy whenever it takes any action. If it is not
      carrying out a correct policy, it is carrying out a wrong
      policy; if it is not carrying out a given policy consciously, it
      is doing so blindly. What we call experience is the process and
      the end-result of carrying out a policy. Only through the
      practice of the people, that is, through experience, can we
      verify whether a policy is correct or wrong and determine to
      what extent it is correct or wrong. However, people's practice,
      especially the practice of a revolutionary party and the
      revolutionary masses, cannot but be bound up with one policy or
      another. Therefore, before any action is taken, we must explain
      the policy, which we have formulated in the light of the given
      circumstances, to Party members and to the masses. Otherwise,
      Party members and the masses will depart from the guidance of
      our policy, act blindly and carry out a wrong policy. </p><p
      class="inline">&quot;On the Policy Concerning Industry and
      Commerce&quot; (February 27, 1948), Selected Works,
      Vol. IV. Pp. 204-05. *</p><p>Our Party has laid down the general
      line and general policy of the Chinese revolution as well as
      various specific lines for work and specific policies. However,
      while many comrades remember our Party's specific lines for work
      and specific policies, they often forget its general line and
      general policy. If we actually forget the Party's general line
      and general policy, then we shall be blind, half-baked,
      muddle-headed revolutionaries, and when we carry out a specific
      line for work and a specific policy, we shall lose our bearings
      and vacillate now to the left and now to the right, and the work
      will suffer. </p><p class="inline">&quot;Speech at a Conference
      of Cadres in the Shansi-Suiyuan Liberated Area&quot; (April 1,
      1948), Selected Works, Vol. IV, p. 238. *</p><p>Policy and
      tactics are the life of the Party; leading comrades at all
      levels must give them full attention and must never on any
      account be negligent. </p><p class="inline">&quot;A Circular on
      the Situation&quot; (March 20, 1948), Selected Works, Vol. IV,
      p. 220.</p>
