30. Youth
</h3>

<hr class="end">
    <p class="skip">&#160;</p>

    <p>The world is yours, as well as ours, but in the last analysis,
    it is yours. You young people, full of vigor and vitality, are in
    the bloom of life, like the sun at eight or nine in the
    morning. Our hope is placed on you. The world belongs to
    you. China's future belongs to you. </p><p class="inline">Talk at
    a meeting with Chinese students and trainees in Moscow (November
    17, 1957).</p><p>We must help all our young people to understand
    that ours is still a very poor country, that we cannot change this
    situation radically in a short time, and that only through the
    united efforts of our younger generation and all our people,
    working with their own hands, can China be made strong and
    prosperous within a period of several decades. The establishment
    of our socialist system has opened the road leading to the ideal
    society of the future, but to translate this ideal into reality
    needs hard work. </p><p class="inline">On the Correct Handling of
    Contradictions Among the People (February 27, 1957), 1st pocket
    ed., pp. 44-45.</p><p>Because of their lack of political and
    social experience, quite a number of young people are unable to
    see the contrast between the old China and the new, and it is not
    easy for them thoroughly to comprehend the hardships our people
    went through in the struggle to free themselves from the
    oppression of the imperialists and Kuomintang reactionaries, or
    the long period of arduous work needed before a happy socialist
    society can be established. That is why we must constantly carry
    on lively and effective political education among the masses and
    should always tell them the truth about the difficulties that crop
    up and discuss with them how to surmount these
    difficulties. </p><p class="inline">Ibid., p. 63.</p><p>The young
    people are the most active and vital force in society. They are
    the most eager to learn and the least conservative in their
    thinking. This is especially so in the era of socialism. We hope
    that the local Party organizations in various places will help and
    work with the Youth League organizations and go into the question
    of bringing into full play the energy of our youth in
    particular. The Party organizations should not treat them in the
    same way as everybody else and ignore their special
    characteristics. Of course, the young people should learn from the
    old and other adults, and should strive as much as possible to
    engage in all sorts of useful activities with their
    agreement. </p><p class="inline">Introductory note to &quot;A
    Youth Shock Brigade of the No. 9 Agricultural Producers'
    Co-operative in Hsinping Township, Chungshan County&quot; (1955),
    The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside, Chinese ed.,
    Vol. III.</p><p>How should we judge whether a youth is a
    revolutionary? How can we tell? There can only be one criterion,
    namely, whether or not he is willing to integrate himself with the
    broad masses of workers and peasants and does so in practice. If
    he is willing to do so and actually does so, he is a
    revolutionary; otherwise he is a nonrevolutionary or a
    counter-revolutionary. If today he integrates himself with the
    masses of workers and peasants, then today he is a revolutionary;
    if tomorrow he ceases to do so or turns round to oppress the
    common people, then he becomes a nonrevolutionary or a counter
    revolutionary. </p><p class="inline">&quot;The Orientation of the
    Youth Movement&quot; (May 4, 1939), Selected Works, Vol. II,
    p. 246.</p><p>The intellectuals often tend to be subjective and
    individualistic, impractical in their thinking and irresolute in
    action until they have thrown themselves heart and soul into mass
    revolutionary struggles, or made up their minds to serve the
    interests of the masses and become one with them. Hence although
    the mass of revolutionary intellectuals in China can play a
    vanguard role or serve as a link with the masses, not all of them
    will remain revolutionaries to the end. Some will drop out of the
    revolutionary ranks at critical moments and become passive, while
    a few may even become enemies of the revolution. The intellectuals
    can overcome their shortcomings only in mass struggles over a long
    period. </p><p class="inline">&quot;The Chinese Revolution and the
    Chinese Communist Party&quot; (December 1939), Selected Works,
    Vol. II, p. 322.*</p><p>Apart from continuing to act in
    co-ordination with the Party in its central task, the Youth League
    should do its own work to suit the special characteristics of
    youth. New China must care for her youth and show concern for the
    growth of the younger generation. Young people have to study and
    work, but they are at the age of physical growth. Therefore, full
    attention must be paid both to their work and study and to their
    recreation, sport and rest. </p><p class="inline">Talk at the
    reception for the Presidium of the Second National Congress of the
    Youth League (June 30, 1953).</p>
