23. Investigation and Study
</h3>

<hr class="end">
    <p class="skip">&#160;</p>

    <p>Everyone engaged in practical work must investigate conditions
    at the lower levels. Such investigation is especially necessary
    for those who know theory but do not know the actual conditions,
    for otherwise they will not be able to link theory with
    practice. Although my assertion, &quot;No investigation no right
    to speak&quot;, has been ridiculed as &quot;narrow
    empiricism&quot;, to this day I do not regret having made it; far
    from regretting it, I still insist that without investigation
    there cannot possibly be any right to speak. There are many people
    who &quot;the moment they alight from the official carriage&quot;
    make a hullabaloo, spout opinions, criticize this and condemn
    that; but, in fact, ten out of ten of them will meet with
    failure. For such views or criticisms, which are not based on
    thorough investigation, are nothing but ignorant
    twaddle. Countless times our Party suffered at the hands of these
    &quot;imperial envoys&quot;, who rushed here, there and
    everywhere. Stalin rightly says &quot;theory becomes purposeless
    if it is not connected with revolutionary practice&quot;. And he
    rightly adds that &quot;practice gropes in the dark if its path is
    not illumined by revolutionary theory&quot;. Nobody should be
    labeled a &quot;narrow empiricist&quot; except the &quot;practical
    man&quot; who gropes in the dark and lacks perspective and
    foresight. </p><p class="inline">&quot;Preface and Postscript to
    Rural Surveys&quot; (March and April 1941), Selected Works,
    Vol. III, p. 13. *</p><p>To take such an attitude is to seek truth
    from facts. &quot;Facts&quot; are all the things that exist
    objectively, &quot;truth&quot; means their internal relations,
    that is, the laws governing them, and &quot;to seek,&quot; means
    to study. We should proceed from the actual conditions inside and
    outside the country, the province, county or district, and derive
    from them, as our guide to action, laws that are inherent in them
    and not imaginary, that is, we should find the internal relations
    of the events occurring around us. And in order to do that we must
    rely not on subjective imagination, not on momentary enthusiasm,
    not on lifeless books, but on facts that exist objectively; we
    must appropriate the material in detail and, guided by the general
    principles of Marxism-Leninism, draw correct conclusions from
    it. </p><p class="inline">&quot;Reform Our Study&quot; (May 1941),
    Selected Works, Vol. III, pp. 22-23.</p><p>To behave like &quot;a
    blindfolded man catching sparrows&quot;, or &quot;a blind man
    groping for fish&quot;, to be crude and careless, to indulge in
    verbiage, to rest content with a smattering of knowledge - such is
    the extremely bad style of work that still exists among many
    comrades in our Party, a style utterly opposed to the fundamental
    spirit of Marxism-Leninism. Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin have
    taught us that it is necessary to study conditions conscientiously
    and to proceed from objective reality and not from subjective
    wishes; however, many of our comrades act in direct violation of
    this truth. </p><p class="inline">Ibid. p. 18.</p><p>You can't
    solve a problem? Well, get down and investigate the present facts
    and its past history! When you have investigated the problem
    thoroughly, you will know how to solve it. Conclusions invariably
    come after investigation, and not before. Only a blockhead cudgels
    his brains on his own, or together with a group, to &quot;find a
    solution&quot; or &quot;evolve an idea&quot; without making any
    investigation. It must be stressed that this cannot possibly lead
    to any effective solution or any good idea. </p><p
    class="inline">Oppose Book Worship (May 1930), 1st pocket ed., and
    p. 2.</p><p>Investigation may be likened to the long months of
    pregnancy, and solving a problem to the day of birth. To
    investigate a problem is, indeed, to solve it. </p><p
    class="inline">Ibid. p. 3.</p><p>[With the Marxist-Leninist
    attitude,] a person applies the theory and method of
    Marxism-Leninism to the systematic and thorough investigation and
    study of the environment. He does not work by enthusiasm alone
    but, as Stalin says, combines revolutionary sweep with
    practicalness. </p><p class="inline">&quot;Reform Our Study&quot;
    (May 1941), Selected Works, Vol. III, p. 22.</p><p>The only way to
    know conditions is to make social investigations, to investigate
    the conditions of each social class in real life. For those
    charged with directing work, the basic method for knowing
    conditions is to concentrate on a few cities and villages
    according to a plan and, using the fundamental viewpoint of
    Marxism, i.e., the method of class analysis, make a number of
    thorough investigations. </p><p class="inline">&quot;Preface and
    Postscript to Rural Surveys&quot; (March and April 1941), Selected
    Works, Vol. III, p. 11. *</p><p>A fact-finding meeting need not be
    large; from three to five or seven or eight people are
    enough. Ample time must be allowed and an outline for the
    investigation must be prepared; furthermore, one must personally
    ask questions, take notes and have discussions with those at the
    meeting. Therefore one certainly cannot make an investigation, or
    do it well, without zeal, a determination to direct one's eyes
    downward and a thirst for knowledge, and without shedding the ugly
    mantle of pretentiousness and becoming a willing pupil. </p><p
    class="inline">Ibid. p. 12.</p><p>A commander's correct
    dispositions stem from his correct decisions, his correct
    decisions stem from his correct judgements, and his correct
    judgements stem from a thorough and necessary reconnaissance and
    from pondering on and piecing together the data of various kinds
    gathered through reconnaissance. He applies all possible and
    necessary methods of reconnaissance, and ponders on the
    information gathered about the enemy's situation, discarding the
    dross and selecting the essential, eliminating the false and
    retaining the true, proceeding from the one to the other and from
    the outside to the inside; then, he takes the conditions on his
    own side into account, and makes a study of both sides and their
    interrelations, thereby forming his judgements, making up his mind
    and working out his plans. Such is the complete process of knowing
    a situation that a military man goes through before he formulates
    a strategic plan, a campaign plan or a battle plan. </p><p
