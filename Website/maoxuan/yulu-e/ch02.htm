<h3>
2. Classes and Class Struggle
</h3>

<hr class="end">
    <p class="skip">&#160;</p>

    <P>Classes struggle, some classes triumph, others are
    eliminated. Such is history; such is the history of civilization
    for thousands of years. To interpret history from this viewpoint
    is historical materialism; standing in opposition to this
    viewpoint is historical idealism. </p><p class="inline">&quot;Cast
    Away Illusions, Prepare for Struggle&quot; (August 14, 1949),
    Selected Works, Vol. IV, p. 428.</p><p>In class society, everyone
    lives as a member of a particular class, and every kind of
    thinking, without exception, is stamped with the brand of a
    class. </p><p class="inline">&quot;On Practice&quot; (July 1937),
    Selected Works, Vol. I, p. 296.</p><p>Changes in society are due
    chiefly to the development of the internal contradictions in
    society, that is, the contradiction between the productive forces
    and the relations of production, the contradiction between classes
    and the contradiction between the old and the new; it is the
    development of these contradictions that pushes society forward
    and gives the impetu6 for the suppression of the old society by
    the new. </p><p class="inline">&quot;On Contradiction&quot;
    (August 1937), Selected Works, Vol. I, P. 314.</p><p>The ruthless
    economic exploitation and political oppression of the peasants by
    the landlord class forced them into numerous uprisings against its
    rule.... It was the class struggles of the peasants, the peasant
    uprisings and peasant wars that constituted the real motive force
    of historical development in Chinese feudal society. </p><p
    class="inline">&quot;The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese
    Communist Party&quot; (December 1939), Selected Works, Vol. II,
    p. 308.*</p><p>In the final analysis, national struggle is a
    matter of class struggle. Among the whites in the United States,
    it is only the reactionary ruling circles that oppress the black
    people. They can in no way represent the workers, farmers,
    revolutionary intellectuals and other enlightened persons who
    comprise the overwhelming majority of the white people. </p><p
    class="inline">&quot;Statement Supporting the American Negroes in
    Their Just Struggle Against Racial Discrimination by
    U.S. Imperialism&quot; (August 8, 1963), People of the World,
    Unite and Defeat the U.S. Aggressors and All Their Lackeys, 2nd
    ed., pp. 3-4. *</p><p>It is up to us to organize the people. As
    for the reactionaries in China, it is up to us to organize the
    people to overthrow them. Everything reactionary is the same; if
    you do not hit it, it will not fall. This is also like sweeping
    the floor; as a rule, where the broom does not reach, the dust
    will not vanish of itself. </p><p class="inline">&quot;The
    Situation and Our Policy After the Victory in the War of
    Resistance Against Japan&quot; (August 13, 1945), Selected Works,
    Vol. IV, p. 19.</p><p>The enemy will not perish of
    himself. Neither will the Chinese reactionaries nor the aggressive
    forces of U.S. imperialism in China step down from the stage of
    history of their own accord. </p><p class="inline">&quot;Carry the
    Revolution Through to the End&quot; (December 30, 1948), Selected
    Works, Vol. IV, p. 301.</p><p>A revolution is not a dinner party,
    or writing an essay, or painting a picture, or doing embroidery;
    it cannot be so refined, so leisurely and gentle, so temperate,
    kind, courteous, restrained and magnanimous. A revolution is an
    insurrection, an act of violence by which one class overthrows
    another. </p><p class="inline">&quot;Report on an Investigation of
    the Peasant Movement in Hunan&quot; (March 1927), Selected Works,
    Vol. I, p. 28.*</p><p>Chiang Kai-shek always tries to wrest every
    ounce of power and every ounce of gain from the people. And we?
    Our policy is to give him retaliation and to fight for every inch
    of land. We act after his fashion. He always tries to impose war
    on the people, one sword in his left hand and another in his
    right. We take up swords, too, following his example.... As Chiang
    Kai-shek is now sharpening his swords, we must sharpen ours
    too. </p><p class="inline">&quot;The Situation and Our Policy
    After the Victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan&quot;
    (August 13, 1945), Selected Works, Vol. IV, pp. 14-l5.</p><p>Who
    are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is a question of the
    first importance for the revolution. The basic reason why all
    previous revolutionary struggles in China achieved so little was
    their failure to unite with real friends in order to attack real
    enemies. A revolutionary party is the guide of the masses, and no
    revolution ever succeeds when the revolutionary party leads them
    astray. To ensure that we will definitely achieve success in our
    revolution and will not lead the masses astray, we must pay
    attention to uniting with our real friends in order to attack our
    real enemies. To distinguish real friends from real enemies, we
    must make a general analysis of the economic status of the various
    classes in Chinese society and of their respective attitudes
    towards the revolution. </p><p class="inline">&quot;Analysis of
    the Classes in Chinese Society&quot; (March 1926), Selected Works,
    Vol. I, p. 13.</p><p>Our enemies are all those in league with
    imperialism - the warlords, the bureaucrats, the comprador class,
    the big Landlord class and the reactionary section of the
    intelligentsia attached to them. The leading force in our
    revolution is the industrial proletariat. Our closest friends are
    the entire semi-proletariat and petty bourgeoisie. As for the
    vacillating middle bourgeoisie, their right wing may become our
    enemy and their left wing may become our friend - but we must be
    constantly on our guard and not let them create confusion within
    our ranks. </p><p class="inline">Ibid. p. 19.*</p><p>Whoever sides
    with the revolutionary people is a revolutionary. Whoever sides
    with imperialism, feudalism and bureaucrat-capitalism is a
    counter-revolutionary. Whomever sides with the revolutionary
    people in words only but acts otherwise is a revolutionary in
    speech. Whoever sides with the revolutionary people in deed as
    well as in word is a revolutionary in the full sense. </p><p
    class="inline">Closing speech at the Second Session of the First
    National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
    Conference (June 23, 1950).</p><p>I hold that it is bad as far as
    we are concerned if a person, a political party, an army or a
    school is not attacked by the enemy, for in that case it would
    definitely mean that we have sunk to the level of the enemy. It is
    good if we are attacked by the enemy, since it proves that we have
    drawn a clear line of demarcation between the enemy and
    ourselves. It is still better if the enemy attacks us wildly and
    paints us as utterly black and without a single virtue; it
    demonstrates that we have not only drawn a clear line of
    demarcation between the enemy and ourselves but achieved a great
    deal in our work. </p><p class="inline">To Be Attacked by the
    Enemy Is Not a Bad Thing but a Good Thing (May 26, 1939), first
    pocket ed., p. two. *</p><p>We should support whatever the enemy
    opposes and oppose whatever the enemy supports. </p><p
    class="inline">&quot;Interview with Three Correspondents from the
    Central News Agency, the Sao Tang Pao and the Hsin Min Pao&quot;
    (September 16, 1939), Selected Works, Vol. II, p. 272.</p><p>Our
    stand is that of the proletariat and of the masses. For members of
    the Communist Party, this means keeping to the stand of the Party,
    keeping to Party spirit and Party policy. </p><p
    class="inline">&quot;Talks at the Yenan Forum on Literature and
    Art&quot; (May 1942), Selected Works, Vol. III, p. 70.</p><p>After
    the enemies with guns have been wiped out, there will still be
    enemies without guns; they are bound to struggle desperately
    against us, and we must never regard these enemies lightly. If we
    do nor now raise and understand the problem in this way, we shall
    commit the gravest mistakes. </p><p class="inline">&quot;Report to
    the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the
    Communist Party of China&quot; (March 5, 1949), Selected Works,
    Vol. IV, p. 364.</p><p>The imperialists and domestic reactionaries
    will certainly not take their defeat Lying down and they will
    struggle to the last ditch. After there is peace and order
    throughout the country, they will still engage in sabotage and
    create disturbances in various ways and will try every day and
    every minute to stage a comeback. This is inevitable, beyond all
    doubt, and under no circumstances must we relax our
    vigilance. </p><p class="inline">Opening address at the First
    Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
    Conference (September 21. 1949).</p><p>In China, although in the
    main socialist transformation has been completed with respect to
    the system of ownership, and although the large-scale and
    turbulent class struggles of the masses characteristic of the
    previous revolutionary periods have in the main come to an end,
    there are still remnants of the overthrown landlord and comprador
    classes, there is still a bourgeoisie, and the remolding of the
    petty bourgeoisie has only just started. The class struggle is by
    no means over. The class struggle between the proletariat and the
    bourgeoisie, the class struggle between the different political
    forces, and the class struggle in the ideological held between the
    proletariat and the bourgeoisie will continue to be long and
    tortuous and at times will even become very acute. The proletariat
    seeks to transform the world according to its own world outlook,
    and so does the bourgeoisie. In this respect, the question of
    which will win out, socialism or capitalism, is still not really
    settled. </p><p class="inline">On the Correct Handling of
    Contradictions among the People (February 27, 1957), 1st pocket
    ed., pp. 51-52.</p><p>It will take a long period to decide the
    issue in the ideological struggle between socialism and capitalism
    in our country. The reason is that the influence of the
    bourgeoisie and of the intellectuals who come from the old society
    will remain in our country for a long time to come, and so will
    their class ideology. If this is not sufficiently understood, or
    is not understood at all, the gravest mistakes will be made and
    the necessity of waging the struggle in the ideological field will
    be ignored. </p><p class="inline">Ibid. pp. 52-53.</p><p>In our
    country bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideology, anti-Marxist
    ideology will continue to exist for a long time. Basically, the
    socialist system has been established in our country. We have won
    the basic victory in transforming the ownership of the means of
    production, but we have not yet won complete victory on the
    political and ideological fronts. In the ideological field, the
    question of who will win in the struggle between the proletariat
    and the bourgeoisie has not been really settled yet. We still have
    to wage a protracted struggle against bourgeois and petty
    bourgeois ideology. It is wrong not to understand this and to give
    up ideological struggle. All erroneous ideas, all poisonous weeds,
    all ghosts and monsters, must be subjected to criticism; in no
    circumstance should they be allowed to spread unchecked. However,
    the criticism should be fully reasoned, analytical and convincing,
    and not rough, bureaucratic, metaphysical or dogmatic. </p><p
    class="inline">Speech at the Chinese Communist Party's National
    Conference on Propaganda Work (March 12, 1957), 1st pocket ed.,
    and pp. 26-27. *</p><p>Both dogmatism and revisionism run counter
    to Marxism. Marxism must certainly advance; it must develop along
    with the development of practice and cannot stand still. It would
    become lifeless if it remained stagnant and stereotyped. However,
    the basic principles of Marxism must never be violated, or
    otherwise mistakes will be made. It is dogmatism to approach
    Marxism from a metaphysical point of view and to regard it as
    something rigid. It is revisionism to negate the basic principles
    of Marxism and to negate its universal truth. Revisionism is one
    form of bourgeois ideology. The revisionists deny the differences
    between socialism and capitalism, between the dictatorship of the
    proletariat and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. What they
    advocate is in fact not the socialist line but the capitalist
    line. In present circumstances, revisionism is more pernicious
    than dogmatism. One of our current important tasks on the
    ideological front is to unfold criticism of revisionism. </p><p
    class="inline">Ibid. pp. 27-28.</p><p>Revisionism, or Right
    opportunism, is a bourgeois trend of thought that is even more
    dangerous than dogmatism. The revisionists, the Right
    opportunists, pay lip service to Marxism; they too attack
    &quot;dogmatism&quot;. However, what they are really attacking is
    the quintessence of Marxism. They oppose or distort materialism
    and dialectics, oppose or try to weaken the people's democratic
    dictatorship and the leading role of the Communist Party, and
    oppose or try to weaken socialist transformation and socialist
    construction. After the basic victory of the socialist revolution
    in our country, there are still a number of people who vainly hope
    to restore the capitalist system and fight the working class on
    every front, including the ideological one. Moreover, their
    right-hand men in this struggle are the revisionists. </p><p
