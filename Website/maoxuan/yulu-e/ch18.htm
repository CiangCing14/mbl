18. Patriotism and Internationalism
</h3>

<hr class="end">
    <p class="skip">&#160;</p>

    <p>Can a Communist, who is an internationalist, at the same time
    be a patriot? We hold that he not only can be but also must
    be. The specific content of patriotism is determined by historical
    conditions. There is the &quot;patriotism&quot; of the Japanese
    aggressors and of Hitler, and there is our patriotism. Communists
    must resolutely oppose the &quot;patriotism&quot; of the Japanese
    aggressors and of Hitler. The Communists of Japan and Germany are
    defeatists with regard to the wars being waged by their
    countries. To bring about the defeat of the Japanese aggressors
    and of Hitler by every possible means is in the interests of the
    Japanese and the German people, and the more complete the defeat
    the better.... For the wars launched by the Japanese aggressors
    and Hitler are harming the people at home as well as the people of
    the world. China's case, however, is different, because she is the
    victim of aggression. Chinese Communists must therefore combine
    patriotism with internationalism. We are at once internationalists
    and patriots, and our slogan is, &quot;Fight to defend the
    motherland against the aggressors.&quot; For us defeatism is a
    crime and to strive for victory in the War of Resistance is an
    inescapable duty. For only by fighting in defense of the
    motherland can we defeat the aggressors and achieve national
    liberation. And only by achieving national liberation will it be
    possible for the proletariat and other working people to achieve
    their own emancipation. The victory of China and the defeat of the
    invading imperialists will help the people of other
    countries. Thus in wars of national liberation patriotism is
    applied internationalism. </p><p class="inline">&quot;The Role of
    the Chinese Communist Party in the National War&quot; (October
    1938), Selected Works, Vol. II, p. 196. *</p><p>What kind of
    spirit is this that makes a foreigner selflessly adopt the cause
    of the Chinese people's liberation as his own? It is the spirit of
    internationalism, the spirit of communism, from which every
    Chinese Communist must learn.... We must unite with the
    proletariat of all the capitalist countries, with the proletariat
    of Japan, Britain, the United States, Germany, Italy and all other
    capitalist countries, before it is possible to overthrow
    imperialism, to liberate our nation and people, and to liberate
    the other nations and peoples of the world. This is our
    internationalism, the internationalism with which we oppose both
    narrow nationalism and narrow patriotism. </p><p
    class="inline">&quot;In Memory of Norman Bethune&quot; (December
    21, 1939), Selected Works, Vol. II, p. 337. *</p><p>In the fight
    for complete liberation the oppressed people rely first of all on
    their own struggle and then, and only then, on international
    assistance. The people who have triumphed in their own revolution
    should help those still struggling for liberation. This is our
    internationalist duty. </p><p class="inline">Talk with African
    friends (August 8, 1963).</p><p>The socialist countries are states
    of an entirely new type in which the exploiting classes have been
    overthrown and the working people are in power. The principle of
    integrating internationalism with patriotism is practiced in the
    relations between these countries. Common interests and common
    ideals closely bind us. </p><p class="inline">&quot;Speech at the
    Meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR in Celebration of the
    40th Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution&quot;
    (November 6, 1957).</p><p>The people of the countries in the
    socialist camp should unite, the people of the countries in Asia,
    Africa and Latin America should unite, the people of all the
    continents should unite, all peace-loving countries should unite,
    and all countries subjected to U.S. aggression, control,
    intervention or bullying should unite, and so form the broadest
    united front to oppose the U.S. imperialist policies of aggression
    and war and to defend world peace. </p><p
    class="inline">&quot;Statement Supporting the Panamanian People's
    Just Patriotic Struggle Against U.S. Imperialism&quot; (January
    12, 1964), People of the World, Unite and Defeat the
    U.S. Aggressors and All Their Lackeys, 2nd ed., p. 9.</p><p>Things
    develop ceaselessly. It is only forty-five years since the
    Revolution of 1911, but the face of China has completely
    changed. In another forty-five years, that is, in the year 2001,
    or the beginning of the 21st century, China will have undergone an
    even greater change. She will have become a powerful socialist
    industrial country. And that is as it should be. China is a land
    with an area of 9,600,000 square kilometers and a population of
    600 million people, and she ought to have made a greater
    contribution to humanity. Her contribution over a long period has
    been far too small. For this we are regretful. But we must be
    modest - not only now, but forty-five years hence as well. We
    should always be modest. In our international relations, we
    Chinese people should get rid of great-power chauvinism
    resolutely, thoroughly, wholly and completely. </p><p
    class="inline">&quot;In Commemoration of Dr. Sun Yat-sen&quot;
    (November 1956).</p><p>We must never adopt an arrogant attitude of
    great-power chauvinism and become conceited because of the victory
    of our revolution and certain achievements in our
    construction. Every nation, big or small, has its strong and weak
    points. </p><p class="inline">&quot;Opening Address at the Eighth
    National Congress of the Communist Party of China&quot; (September
    15, 1956).</p>
